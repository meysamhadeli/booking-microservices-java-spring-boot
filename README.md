## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Keycloak Service`: The Keycloak Service is a identity provider for the authentication and authorization of users using [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak). This service is responsible for creating new users and their corresponding roles permissions and handeling authentication and authorization with OpenID-Connect and OAuth2.

- `Flight Service`: The Flight Service is a bounded context `CRUD` service to handle flight related operations.

- `Passenger Service`: The Passenger Service is a bounded context for managing passenger information, tracking activities and subscribing to get notification for out of stock products.

- `Booking Service`: The Booking Service is a bounded context for managing all operation related to booking ticket.

## Structure of Project

In this project I used a mix of [clean architecture](https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started/), [vertical slice architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) and I used [feature folder structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders/) to structure my files.

I used [yarp reverse proxy](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/index.html) to route synchronous and asynchronous requests to the corresponding microservice. Each microservice has its dependencies such as databases, files etc. Each microservice is decoupled from other microservices and developed and deployed separately. Microservices talk to each other with Rest or gRPC for synchronous calls and use RabbitMq or Kafka for asynchronous calls.

We have a separate microservice [Keycloak Service](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) for authentication and authorization of each request. Once signed-in users are issued a JWT token. This token is used by other microservices to validate the user, read claims and allow access to authorized/role specific endpoints.

I used [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq) as my MessageBroker for async communication between microservices using the eventual consistency mechanism. Each microservice uses [MassTransit](https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit) to interface with [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/rabbitmq) providing, messaging, availability, reliability, etc.

Microservices are `event based` which means they can publish and/or subscribe to any events occurring in the setup. By using this approach for communicating between services, each microservice does not need to know about the other services or handle errors occurred in other microservices.

After saving data in write side, I save a [Internal Command](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd#38-internal-processing) record in my Persist Messages storage (like something we do in outbox pattern) and after committing transaction in write side, trigger our command handler in read side  and this handler could save their read models in our MongoDB database.

I treat each request as a distinct use case or slice, encapsulating and grouping all concerns from front-end to back.
When adding or changing a feature in an application in n-tire architecture, we are typically touching many "layers" in an application. We are changing the user interface, adding fields to models, modifying validation, and so on. Instead of coupling across a layer, we couple vertically along a slice. We `minimize coupling` `between slices`, and `maximize coupling` `in a slice`.

With this approach, each of our vertical slices can decide for itself how to best fulfill the request. New features only add code, we're not changing shared code and worrying about side effects.

</div>

Instead of grouping related action methods in one controller, as found in traditional controllers, I used the [REPR pattern](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/repr-design-pattern). Each action gets its own small endpoint, consisting of a route, the action, and an `IMediator` instance. The request is passed to the `IMediator` instance, routed through a [`Mediator pipeline`](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/09/09/tackling-cross-cutting-concerns-with-a-mediator-pipeline/) where custom middleware can log, validate and intercept requests. The request is then handled by a request specific `IRequestHandler` which performs business logic before returning the result.

The use of the [mediator pattern](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2019/04/30/the-mediator-pattern-in-net-core-part-1-whats-a-mediator/) in my controllers creates clean and thin controllers. By separating action logic into individual handlers we support the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) and [Don't Repeat Yourself principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), this is because traditional controllers tend to become bloated with large action methods and several injected `Services` only being used by a few methods.

I used CQRS to decompose my features into small parts that makes our application:

- Maximize performance, scalability and simplicity.
- Easy to maintain and add features to. Changes only affect one command or query, avoiding breaking changes or creating side effects.
- It gives us better separation of concerns and cross-cutting concern (with help of mediator behavior pipelines), instead of bloated service classes doing many things.

Using the CQRS pattern, we cut each business functionality into vertical slices, for each of these slices we group classes (see [technical folders structure](http://www.kamilgrzybek.com/design/feature-folders)) specific to that feature together (command, handlers, infrastructure, repository, controllers, etc). In our CQRS pattern each command/query handler is a separate slice. This is where you can reduce coupling between layers. Each handler can be a separated code unit, even copy/pasted. Thanks to that, we can tune down the specific method to not follow general conventions (e.g. use custom SQL query or even different storage). In a traditional layered architecture, when we change the core generic mechanism in one layer, it can impact all methods.


## How to Run

> ### Docker Compose

Use the command below to run our `infrastructure` with `docker` using the `docker-compose.infrastructure.yaml` file at the root of the app:
```
docker-compose -f ./deployments/docker-compose/docker-compose.infrastructure.yaml up -d
```

> ### Build
To `build` all microservices, run this command in the `root` of each microservice where the `pom.xml` file is located:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

> ### Run
To `run` each microservice, run this command in the `root` of each microservice where the `pom.xml` file is located:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

> ### Test

To `test` all microservices, run this command in the `root` of each microservice where the `pom.xml` file is located:
```bash
dotnet test
```

> ### Documentation Apis

Each microservice provides `API documentation` and navigate to `/swagger-ui/index.html` to visit list of endpoints.

As part of API testing, I created the [booking.rest](./booking.rest) file which can be run with the [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) `VSCode plugin`.
